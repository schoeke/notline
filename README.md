# Simple notifications for Jackline on Mac OS

This project uses [Terminal Notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier). You can install it with

`brew install terminal-notifier` if you have [brew](http://brew.sh/) installed 
or
`gem install terminal-notifier` if you prefer ruby.

This is a very basic script and can take the location of a state file as one optional argument. This is for the case that your config folder is in a non-default location.
Out of the box, it checks the state file every 5 seconds. Feel free to decrease or increase this timeout by editing line 33.
